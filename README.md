# UNet_Remote_Sensing
 A project designed to demonstrate applying semantic segmentation to remote sensing data

This was a fun project I did during my last year of undergraduate, as part of an extension to my remote sensing class. It effectively acted as an independent study and allowed me to apply concepts from a prior internship to another form of geophysical data. It's also a great example of one of the many ways that geophysical data and machine learning can mesh.

The data that this repository uses cannot be distributed to third parties, so I kindly ask that you request it from the ISPRS here: http://www2.isprs.org/commissions/comm3/wg4/data-request-form2.html. The form appears to be automated, so by filling it out, you should automatically receive a download link. Be sure to check your spam folder. Request the 2D segmentation data (Vaihingen). Download the zip files containing the data and entire ground truth, unzip as necessary and place the subfolders into the repo folder titled "ISPRS". The subfolders should be titled "dsm", "gt", and "top". ISPRS provides some other data as well, but these three items are what we need.
